# HPM 883 Computing Setup Guide

This guide walks you through setting up your computing environment for HPM 883. Complete these steps **before the first class** or during the first week.

::: {.callout-important}
## Required Software

You need to install:

1. **R** (version 4.3 or higher)
2. **Positron** (recommended) or RStudio
3. **Git** and a GitHub account
4. **Posit Cloud** account ($5/month)
5. **Quarto** (usually bundled with Positron/RStudio)
:::

---

## Step 1: Install R

### Windows

Open PowerShell and run:

```bash
winget install --id R-project.R
```

Or download from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/).

### macOS

Open Terminal and run:

```bash
brew install --cask r
```

Or download from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/).

### Verify Installation

Open a terminal and type:

```bash
R --version
```

You should see R version 4.3.0 or higher.

---

## Step 2: Install Positron (Recommended IDE)

**Positron** is Posit's new IDE with built-in AI assistance. It's free and actively developed.

### Download

1. Go to [positron.posit.co](https://positron.posit.co/)
2. Download the installer for your operating system
3. Run the installer

### Why Positron?

| Feature | Positron | RStudio |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Built-in AI assistant | ✓ Yes | No |
| VS Code extensions | ✓ 1000s | Limited |
| Active development | ✓ Very active | Maintenance only |
| Python support | First-class | Secondary |
| Price | Free | Free |

### Alternative: RStudio

If you prefer RStudio, download from [posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).

---

## Step 3: Install Git and Create GitHub Account

### Install Git

**Windows:**

```bash
winget install Git.Git
```

**macOS:**

```bash
brew install git
```

### Configure Git

Open a terminal and run (use your actual name and email):

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@unc.edu"
```

### Create GitHub Account

1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com/)
2. Sign up with your UNC email (you get free Pro features as a student)
3. Verify your email address

### Connect Git to GitHub

Generate an SSH key (recommended):

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your.email@unc.edu"
```

Press Enter to accept defaults. Then add to GitHub:

1. Copy your public key: `cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`
2. Go to GitHub → Settings → SSH and GPG keys → New SSH key
3. Paste and save

### Verify Connection

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

You should see: "Hi username! You've successfully authenticated..."

---

## Step 4: Set Up Posit Cloud

Posit Cloud provides a browser-based R environment for in-class exercises.

### Create Account

1. Go to [posit.cloud](https://posit.cloud/)
2. Sign up with your UNC email
3. Subscribe to the **Student plan** ($5/month)

::: {.callout-note}
## Course Requirement

The $5/month Posit Cloud subscription is a required course cost. This gives you:

- 75 project hours/month (plenty for class)
- 4 GB RAM per project
- Up to 20 projects
:::

### Join Course Workspace

After enrollment, you'll receive a link to join the HPM 883 course workspace. This gives you access to pre-configured projects for in-class exercises.

---

## Step 5: Install Quarto

Quarto is the publishing system we use for labs and the capstone project.

### Check if Already Installed

Positron and recent RStudio versions include Quarto. Check:

```bash
quarto --version
```

If not found, download from [quarto.org/docs/get-started](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/).

---

## Step 6: Accept GitHub Classroom Assignment

Once the semester starts, you'll receive GitHub Classroom assignment links.

### How It Works

1. Click the assignment link (e.g., `https://classroom.github.com/a/xyz123`)
2. Authorize GitHub Classroom (first time only)
3. Accept the assignment → This creates your personal repository
4. Clone to your computer:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:unc-hpm-quant/lab-0-yourusername.git
```

5. Open the `.Rproj` file in Positron/RStudio

### First Time Setup (renv)

When you first open a project, restore packages:

```r
renv::restore()
```

This installs all required packages in the correct versions.

---

## Workflow Summary

### In-Class Exercises (Posit Cloud)

1. Log into Posit Cloud
2. Open the class project
3. Follow along with the instructor
4. No submission needed (formative)

### Labs & Assignments (Local + GitHub)

1. Accept GitHub Classroom assignment
2. Clone to local machine
3. Open in Positron/RStudio
4. Run `renv::restore()` (first time)
5. Complete the assignment
6. Render to HTML
7. Commit and push to GitHub
8. Verify submission on GitHub

### Capstone Project

Same as labs, but uses the extended capstone template with:

- `targets` pipeline
- Pre-analysis plan
- Multi-file structure

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| `renv::restore()` fails | Delete `renv/library/`, restart R, try again |
| Package not found | Run `renv::install("package_name")` |
| Git push rejected | Run `git pull` first, then push |
| Quarto render fails | Check YAML header syntax |
| GitHub auth fails | Regenerate SSH key, re-add to GitHub |
| Posit Cloud slow | Increase project RAM in settings |

### Getting Help

1. **Slack #hpm883-help** — Post questions, classmates can help
2. **Office Hours** — See course schedule
3. **GitHub Issues** — For persistent technical problems
