title: "Unit 0: Foundations"
subtitle: "Session 0.3: Potential Outcomes & Structural Causal Models"
date: "January 14, 2026"
---

## Session Overview

This session establishes the theoretical foundations for causal inference that we'll build upon throughout the course. We'll cover the potential outcomes framework (Rubin causal model) and structural causal models (DAGs), understanding when each framework is most useful.

**Format:** In-Person (Rosenau 228)

**Learning Objectives:**

1. Define causal effects using the potential outcomes framework
2. Understand the fundamental problem of causal inference
3. Read and interpret directed acyclic graphs (DAGs)
4. Identify confounding, colliders, and mediators in causal graphs
5. Connect DAGs to identification strategies

**Topics Covered:**

1. **Potential Outcomes Framework**
   - Notation: $Y_i(1)$, $Y_i(0)$, treatment effects
   - Individual vs. average treatment effects (ITE, ATE, ATT)
   - The fundamental problem of causal inference
   - SUTVA assumptions
