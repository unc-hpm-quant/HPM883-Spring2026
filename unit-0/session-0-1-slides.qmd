## Today's Journey

![Session 0.1 Roadmap](media/session-0-1-roadmap.png){fig-alt="Session roadmap showing today's flow: Course Overview, Assessment & Grading, Causal Inference Foundations, Course Framework, Next Steps" width="100%"}

::: {.notes}
Let me walk you through what we'll cover today. We'll start with course logistics and assessment, then dive into the core of what this course is about — causal inference foundations. We'll close with the three-layer framework that structures the entire course.
:::

# Course Overview {.center}

## Course Philosophy

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
### What This Course Is

- **Applied focus**: Real health policy problems

# The Central Question {.center}

## Why Are We Here?

> When does a health intervention **cause** an outcome to change?

::: fragment
This is fundamentally different from:

- "Are intervention and outcome **associated**?"
- "Can we **predict** outcomes from interventions?"

::: {.callout-important}
## Key Insight
Prediction ≠ Causation. A model that predicts well may tell us nothing about what happens when we intervene.
:::
:::

---

## Prediction vs. Causal Estimation

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
### Prediction (Ŷ)

**Goal:** Forecast outcomes

- Minimize prediction error
- Any features allowed
- Black box OK
- "What will happen?"

**Example:** Predict which patients will be readmitted
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Causal Estimation (β̂)

**Goal:** Estimate treatment effects

- Unbiased estimation
- Confounding matters
- Interpretability needed
- "What if we intervene?"

**Example:** Does discharge planning *reduce* readmissions?
:::
:::

::: fragment
::: {.callout-warning}
## Common Mistake
Using predictive models to make causal claims. Correlation in $\hat{Y}$ ≠ Causation in $\hat{\beta}$.
:::
:::

# The Three-Layer Causal Inference Stack {.center}

## Course Framework

::: {.callout-note}
## Organizing Principle
This three-layer stack is our pedagogical framework for the course — a tool for understanding how methods relate.
:::

![Three-Layer Causal Inference Stack](images/three-layer-stack.png){fig-alt="Three-layer stack: Identification at bottom, Estimation in middle, Decision at top" width="80%"}

---

## Layer 1: Identification

**The Question**: Under what assumptions can we interpret an estimate as causal?

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
### Tools
- Potential outcomes framework
- Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)
- Identification strategies
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Course Coverage
- Unit 0: Foundations
- Unit 1: Experimental design
- Unit 5-6: Observational strategies
:::
:::

::: {.callout-note}
## Identification First
No amount of sophisticated estimation can rescue a study with flawed identification.
:::

---

## Layer 2: Estimation

**The Question**: Given valid identification, how do we estimate effects efficiently?

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
### Tools
- Double/Debiased ML
- Doubly-robust estimation
- Causal forests
- Influence functions
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Course Coverage
- Unit 2: DR & DML
- Unit 3: Heterogeneous effects
- Units 5-6: Advanced methods
:::
:::

::: {.callout-tip}
## Modern Estimation
ML methods excel at high-dimensional nuisance estimation while preserving valid inference on causal parameters.
:::

---

## Layer 3: Decision

**The Question**: Given estimated effects, what action should we take?

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
### Tools
- Policy learning
- Treatment rules
- Off-policy evaluation
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Course Coverage
- Unit 4: Policy learning
- Unit 8: Capstone projects
:::
:::

::: {.callout-warning}
## Decision Under Uncertainty
Optimal decisions depend not just on average effects, but on heterogeneity and constraints.
:::

# How ML Helps with Causal Inference {.center}

## The Potential Outcomes Framework

### The Fundamental Setup

For each unit $i$:

- $Y_i(1)$: Outcome if unit receives treatment
- $Y_i(0)$: Outcome if unit receives control
- $D_i$: Treatment indicator (1 = treated, 0 = control)

::: fragment
### The Individual Treatment Effect

$$\tau_i = Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)$$

The causal effect for unit $i$ is the difference between what would happen under treatment versus control.

::: {.notes}
This notation will be used throughout the course. Y(1) is the potential outcome under treatment, Y(0) under control. These are counterfactual outcomes—we can only ever observe one for each unit.
:::
:::

---

## The Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference

::: {.callout-warning}
## The Problem
We can never observe both $Y_i(1)$ and $Y_i(0)$ for the same unit.
:::

| Unit | $Y_i(1)$ | $Y_i(0)$ | $\tau_i$ |
|------|----------|----------|----------|
| 1    | 8        | ?        | ?        |
| 2    | ?        | 5        | ?        |
| 3    | 7        | ?        | ?        |
| 4    | ?        | 6        | ?        |

::: fragment
**The missing data problem**: Every causal inference method is fundamentally about dealing with missing counterfactual outcomes.
:::

---

## Solution 1: Randomization

### Under Random Assignment

$$\text{ATE} = E[Y | D=1] - E[Y | D=0]$$

**Why does this work?**

::: fragment
Randomization ensures treatment and control groups are *exchangeable*:

$$E[Y(1) | D=1] = E[Y(1) | D=0] = E[Y(1)]$$

$$E[Y(0) | D=1] = E[Y(0) | D=0] = E[Y(0)]$$

::: {.callout-tip}
## This is Unit 1
Experimental design: power, randomization inference, blocking, variance reduction.
:::
:::

---

## Solution 2: Conditional Independence

### When Randomization Isn't Possible

Without experiments, we need **conditional ignorability**:

$$Y(1), Y(0) \perp\!\!\!\perp D \mid X$$

"After controlling for $X$, treatment is as good as random."

::: fragment
```{r}
#| fig-width: 6
#| fig-height: 3
#| fig-align: center
library(ggplot2)
library(ggdag)
library(dagitty)

dag <- dagify(
  Y ~ D + X,
  D ~ X,
  exposure = "D",
  outcome = "Y",
  coords = list(x = c(X = 1, D = 0, Y = 2), y = c(X = 1.2, D = 0, Y = 0))
)

# Gillings brand colors
gillings_navy <- "#13294B"
gillings_carolina <- "#4B9CD3"

ggdag(dag, text = FALSE, node_size = 22) +
  geom_dag_point(color = gillings_navy, size = 22) +
  geom_dag_text(color = "white", size = 5, fontface = "bold") +
  geom_dag_edges(edge_color = gillings_navy, edge_width = 1.2) +
  theme_dag() +
  labs(title = "Confounding: X affects both D and Y") +
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 16, color = gillings_navy))
```

**Control for X** → Block the backdoor path → Identify causal effect
:::

## How ML Helps: Nuisance Estimation

### The Problem with High-Dimensional X

Traditional approach: Model $E[Y|D,X]$ parametrically

::: fragment
**But what if X is complex?**

- Many covariates
- Nonlinear relationships
- Interactions
:::

::: fragment
### The ML Solution: Double/Debiased ML

Use ML to estimate **nuisance functions** (propensity score, outcome model) while preserving valid inference on $\hat{\tau}$.

::: {.callout-tip}
## This is Unit 2
Influence functions, orthogonal scores, cross-fitting.
:::
:::

---

## Beyond Averages: Treatment Effect Heterogeneity

### Conditional Average Treatment Effect

$$\text{CATE}(x) = E[Y(1) - Y(0) | X = x]$$

The average effect for units with characteristics $X = x$.

::: fragment
### Why It Matters for Health Policy

- **Personalized medicine**: Who benefits most from treatment?
- **Resource allocation**: Where should we target interventions?
- **Equity**: Do effects differ across populations?

::: {.callout-tip}
## This is Units 3-4
Causal forests, meta-learners, policy learning.
:::
:::

---

## ML for Experimental Design

### Adaptive Experiments

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Traditional RCT**

- Fixed assignment probabilities
- Equal allocation
- Static design
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Adaptive/ML-Enhanced**

- Response-adaptive randomization
- Covariate-adaptive allocation
- Bandits and exploration
:::
:::

::: fragment
### How ML Helps

1. **Variance reduction** via covariate adjustment
2. **Blocking and stratification** with many covariates
3. **Adaptive designs** that learn during trial
4. **Power optimization** using baseline predictions

::: {.callout-tip}
## This is Unit 1
Design-based inference with modern tools.

# AI in Your Workflow {.center}

## "AI in the Loop" — Not "Human in the Loop"

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
### Human-Driven, AI-Assisted

1. **You** specify the causal question
2. **You** choose the identification strategy
3. **AI** assists with implementation
4. **You** evaluate and interpret results
5. **You** make the decision
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
### Why It Matters

- AI can't choose your research question
- AI can hallucinate methods
- AI doesn't know your context
- AI can't defend your work
- **You are responsible**
:::
:::

::: {.notes}
This distinction is crucial. Many people talk about "human in the loop" for AI systems. In research, we flip this: the human drives the process, AI assists. You maintain control and responsibility.
