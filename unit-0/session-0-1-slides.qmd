## Welcome to HPM 883 {.center}

**Advanced Quantitative Methods for Health Policy and Management**

Spring 2026

::: {.notes}
Welcome students. This is the third course in the quantitative methods sequence. We're going to explore cutting-edge methods at the intersection of causal inference and machine learning.
:::

---

## Course Philosophy

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
### What This Course Is

- **Applied focus**: Real health policy problems
- **Modern methods**: Causal ML, not just regression
- **Reproducible research**: Code that others can run
- **AI-assisted analysis**: Learning to work *with* AI tools
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### What This Course Is Not

- A statistics refresher (prerequisite: HPM 881-882)
- Pure machine learning for prediction
- Theory without application
- AI doing your thinking for you
:::
:::

::: {.notes}
Set expectations early. This is an advanced course that builds on prior quantitative training. We'll use modern methods but always with a focus on causal questions that matter for health policy.
:::

---

## The Central Question

> When does a health intervention **cause** an outcome to change?

. . .

This is fundamentally different from:

- "Are intervention and outcome **associated**?"
- "Can we **predict** outcomes from interventions?"

::: {.callout-important}
## Key Insight
Prediction ≠ Causation. A model that predicts well may tell us nothing about what happens when we intervene.
:::

## The Three-Layer Causal Inference Stack

        I2["RCTs, Natural experiments"]
        I3["DAGs, Potential outcomes"]

    Layer2 --> Layer3

    style Layer1 fill:#e6f3ff
    style Layer2 fill:#fff2e6
    style Layer3 fill:#e6ffe6
```

::: {.notes}
This three-layer stack is the organizing framework for the entire course. Every method we learn fits somewhere in this stack. Identification comes first—you must know *what* you're estimating before worrying about *how* to estimate it.
:::

---

## Layer 1: Identification

**The Question**: Under what assumptions can we interpret an estimate as causal?

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
### Tools
- Potential outcomes framework
- Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)
- Identification strategies
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Course Coverage
- Unit 0: Foundations
- Unit 1: Experimental design
- Unit 5-6: Observational strategies
:::
:::

::: {.callout-note}
## Identification First
No amount of sophisticated estimation can rescue a study with flawed identification.
:::

---

## Layer 2: Estimation

**The Question**: Given valid identification, how do we estimate effects efficiently?

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
### Tools
- Double/Debiased ML
- Doubly-robust estimation
- Causal forests
- Influence functions
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Course Coverage
- Unit 2: DR & DML
- Unit 3: Heterogeneous effects
- Units 5-6: Advanced methods
:::
:::

::: {.callout-tip}
## Modern Estimation
ML methods excel at high-dimensional nuisance estimation while preserving valid inference on causal parameters.
:::

---

## Layer 3: Decision

**The Question**: Given estimated effects, what action should we take?

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
### Tools
- Policy learning
- Treatment rules
- Off-policy evaluation
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Course Coverage
- Unit 4: Policy learning
- Unit 8: Capstone projects
:::
:::

::: {.callout-warning}
## Decision Under Uncertainty
Optimal decisions depend not just on average effects, but on heterogeneity and constraints.
:::

---

## Why "AI in the Loop"?

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
### Human-Driven, AI-Assisted

1. **You** specify the causal question
2. **You** choose the identification strategy
3. **AI** assists with implementation
4. **You** evaluate and interpret results
5. **You** make the decision

This is **"AI in the Loop"** — not "Human in the Loop"
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
### Why It Matters

- AI can't choose your research question
- AI can hallucinate methods
- AI doesn't know your context
- AI can't defend your work
- **You are responsible**
:::
:::

::: {.notes}
This distinction is crucial. Many people talk about "human in the loop" for AI systems. In research, we flip this: the human drives the process, AI assists. You maintain control and responsibility.
:::

---

## AI in Causal Analysis: Do's and Don'ts

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
### ✅ Good Uses of AI

- Code implementation
- Debugging syntax errors
- Explaining methods
- Generating simulations
- Formatting output
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### ❌ Risky Uses of AI

- Choosing identification strategy
- Interpreting results for you
- Making causal claims
- Selecting variables
- "Just run an analysis"
:::
:::

::: {.callout-important}
## Course Policy
You may use AI tools, but you are responsible for all submitted work. You must understand and be able to explain every line of code and every claim.
:::

---

## Potential Outcomes Framework

### The Fundamental Setup

For each unit $i$:

- $Y_i(1)$: Outcome if unit receives treatment
- $Y_i(0)$: Outcome if unit receives control
- $D_i$: Treatment indicator (1 = treated, 0 = control)

. . .

### The Individual Treatment Effect

$$\tau_i = Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)$$

The causal effect for unit $i$ is the difference between what would happen under treatment versus control.

::: {.notes}
This notation will be used throughout the course. Get comfortable with it. Y(1) is the potential outcome under treatment, Y(0) under control. These are counterfactual outcomes—we can only ever observe one for each unit.
:::

---

## The Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference

::: {.callout-warning}
## The Problem
We can never observe both $Y_i(1)$ and $Y_i(0)$ for the same unit.
:::

| Unit | $Y_i(1)$ | $Y_i(0)$ | $\tau_i$ |
|------|----------|----------|----------|
| 1    | 8        | ?        | ?        |
| 2    | ?        | 5        | ?        |
| 3    | 7        | ?        | ?        |
| 4    | ?        | 6        | ?        |

. . .

**Solution**: Randomization allows us to estimate *average* effects by comparing groups.

---

## Average Treatment Effect (ATE)

### Definition

$$\text{ATE} = E[Y(1) - Y(0)] = E[Y(1)] - E[Y(0)]$$

The average causal effect across the population.

. . .

### Under Random Assignment

$$\text{ATE} = E[Y | D=1] - E[Y | D=0]$$

Why? Because randomization ensures:

$$E[Y(1) | D=1] = E[Y(1)] \quad \text{and} \quad E[Y(0) | D=0] = E[Y(0)]$$

::: {.notes}
This is the magic of randomization. It breaks the link between treatment assignment and potential outcomes, allowing us to estimate average causal effects by comparing means.
:::

---

## Beyond Average Effects: CATE

### Conditional Average Treatment Effect

$$\text{CATE}(x) = E[Y(1) - Y(0) | X = x]$$

The average effect for units with characteristics $X = x$.

. . .

### Why It Matters for Health Policy

- **Personalized medicine**: Who benefits most from treatment?
- **Resource allocation**: Where should we target interventions?
- **Equity**: Do effects differ across populations?

::: {.callout-note}
## Course Focus
Units 3-4 focus on estimating heterogeneous effects using causal forests and policy learning.
:::

---

## Introduction to Causal Graphs (DAGs)

### Directed Acyclic Graphs

Visual representations of causal relationships:

```{mermaid}
%%| fig-alt: "Simple DAG showing Treatment D pointing to Outcome Y, with Confounder X pointing to both D and Y"
flowchart LR
    X["Confounder<br/>X"] --> D["Treatment<br/>D"]
    X --> Y["Outcome<br/>Y"]
    D --> Y

    style X fill:#ffcccc
    style D fill:#cce5ff
    style Y fill:#ccffcc
```

- **Nodes**: Variables
- **Arrows**: Direct causal effects
- **Paths**: Chains of causal relationships

::: {.notes}
DAGs are powerful tools for reasoning about identification. We'll use them throughout the course to think about what we need to control for and what we should not control for.
:::

---

## Why DAGs Matter

### Confounding

```{mermaid}
%%| fig-alt: "DAG showing socioeconomic status (SES) as a confounder affecting both healthcare access and health outcomes"
flowchart LR
    SES["Socioeconomic<br/>Status"] --> Access["Healthcare<br/>Access"]
    SES --> Health["Health<br/>Outcomes"]
    Access --> Health

    style SES fill:#ffcccc
```

SES confounds the relationship between access and health.

. . .

**Without adjustment**: Association ≠ Causation

**With adjustment for SES**: We can isolate the causal effect of access
