## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, you should be able to:

-   Understand the concept of heterogeneous treatment effects and why they matter
-   Distinguish between individual treatment effects, average treatment effects, and conditional average treatment effects
-   Apply different approaches to analyze treatment effect heterogeneity
-   Understand the strengths and limitations of pre-specified and data-driven approaches
-   Interpret heterogeneity findings in published research

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Individual Treatment Effects

**Individual Treatment Effect (ITE)**: $T_i = Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)$

-   The individual-specific causal effect of the treatment
-   $Y_i(1)$ is the potential outcome under treatment
-   $Y_i(0)$ is the potential outcome under control

**Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference**:

-   We only observe one potential outcome per individual
-   It's impossible to directly observe individual treatment effects
-   This makes identifying individual effects infeasible in between-subjects designs

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Average Treatment Effect (ATE)

Given the fundamental problem, we focus on the Average Treatment Effect:

$$
\tau = E[Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)]
$$

-   ATE answers: "What is the expected change in outcome if we randomly select a unit from the population and apply the treatment?"
-   ATE is estimable through randomization
-   **Limitation**: Assuming equal effect for all subjects is often unrealistic
-   Interest in how treatment effects vary with subject characteristics

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Examples of Interest in Heterogeneity

**Real-world examples where heterogeneity matters**:

-   Preventive screening effectiveness: How the benefits of cancer screenings or other preventive services vary by age, risk status, and other patient characteristics
-   Telehealth disparities: How rural and urban populations may experience different benefits from telehealth interventions (particularly relevant given the expansion of telehealth)
-   Care coordination effectiveness: How complex patients with multiple comorbidities might benefit differently from care coordination programs
-   Adherence interventions: How socioeconomic factors might moderate the effectiveness of programs to improve medication adherence
-   Value-based payment impacts: How provider characteristics influence responses to payment reform

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Reasons for Interest in Heterogeneity

::: incremental
1.  **Targeting Treatment**
    -   Should we direct interventions to certain types of people?
    -   Can help maximize impact with limited resources
    -   Ethical considerations in allocation
2.  **Understanding Mechanisms**
    -   Why did treatment work or not work?
    -   Helps refine interventions and theory
3.  **External Validity**
    -   Will effects generalize to new populations?
    -   Crucial for policy scale-up decisions
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Moderation Analysis

**Moderation Analysis**: Examines how treatment effects differ based on pre-determined covariates (moderators)

**Types of moderation analysis:**

-   **Descriptive**: Do treatment effects differ based on pre-determined covariates?
-   **Causal**: If we independently varied the moderator, would we see the same CATEs?

**Interpretation:**

-   Focus not just on measuring heterogeneities, but understanding why they exist
-   Descriptive heterogeneity doesn't necessarily imply causal moderation

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Conditional Average Treatment Effects (CATEs)

**Definition**: $$
\tau(x) = E[\tau(x) | X_i = x] = E[Y_i(1, x) - Y_i(0, x) | X_i = x]
$$

-   Average treatment effect for a subgroup with characteristics $X_i = x$
-   Potential interest in changes in CATEs: $$
    \Delta\tau(X_i) = E[Y_i(1,1) - Y_i(1,0) - Y_i(0,1) - Y_i(0,0)]
    $$

**Limitation**:

-   This object is not directly observed in data
-   Each unit only provides a single potential outcome
-   Each unit has only a single level of $X_i$

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Differences in CATEs

We can measure differences between $\tau(x)$ for different levels of $X_i$:

$$
\Delta\hat\tau(X_i) = \tau(1) - \tau(0) = E[\tau_i(1) | X_i = 1] - E[\tau_i(0) | X_i = 0]
$$

**Important Note**:

-   $\Delta\hat\tau(X_i)$ is descriptive, not causal
-   It can show whether CATE is higher for different levels of $X_i$
-   Cannot answer whether there is a causal effect of $X$ on the treatment effect
-   But still highly valuable for policy and implementation

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Example

**Home-based Parenting Intervention in Rural China (Sylvia et al. 2021)**

**Background**:

-   Randomized experiment evaluating home-based parenting program delivered by family planning cadres in rural China
-   Program significantly increased infant skill development after six months
-   Beyond ATE, wanted to understand heterogeneous effects

**Reasons for examining heterogeneity**:

-   Targeting: Identify which children benefited most
-   Generalization: Understand how effects might vary in other populations
-   Mechanisms: Gain insights into how the program worked

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Approach 1: Pre-specified Hypotheses

**Simple case**: A small set of distinct subgroups that we hypothesize to summarize heterogeneity

With sufficient sample sizes per subgroup, treat each subgroup as a "mini-RCT":

-   Estimate $\hat\tau(X) = E[\tau(X) | X_i = X]$
-   Hold $X$ fixed in estimation
-   Can be done separately or using interaction terms in regression

**Example**: Analyzing treatment effects by baseline parental investment levels

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Sample Size and HTE

-   Moderation analysis requires larger samples or larger MDEs

-   Considerations:

    -   Moderation effects are often smaller than main effects
    -   You can have smaller samples when comparing subgroups
    -   Subgroups don't have to be evenly split

-   Design implications:

    -   Consider oversampling key subgroups
    -   Power calculations should account for heterogeneity analyses
    -   Stratification can improve precision for key subgroups

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Challenges with Pre-specified Approaches

-   Moderation analysis typically involves estimating a series of CATEs
-   With many covariates, quickly becomes infeasible
    -   Particularly with smaller samples
-   Continuous covariates require functional form assumptions
-   Difficult to discover/justify interactions of multiple variables ex post

**Partial solutions**:

-   Pre-analysis plans
-   Data-driven approaches to predict heterogeneity

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Approach 2: ML - Causal Forests

**Causal forests** adapt random forest methods to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects:

-   Trees are trained on subsets of data and features
-   Goal is to partition data to maximize between-group heterogeneity while maintaining within-group homogeneity
-   Repeated many times with random splits of the data
-   ITE estimated by averaging over subgroup effects across iterations

**Advantages**:

-   Can handle high-dimensional covariates
-   Doesn't require functional form assumptions
-   Can discover unexpected patterns of heterogeneity

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Case Study: Heterogeneity in China's Parenting Intervention

**Sylvia et al. (2021) study**:

-   Evaluated home-based parenting program delivered by family planning cadres in rural China
-   Used Generalized Random Forest (GRF) method to identify sources of heterogeneity
-   Two-stage approach:
    1.  Used GRF to identify important predictors of heterogeneity
    2.  Used these insights for traditional subgroup analysis

## GRF Findings: Variable Importance

![](QQ-VI.png)

**Key predictors of heterogeneity:** 1. Baseline parental investment (27.16%) 2. Baseline infant skills (16.73%) 3. Distance to FPC office (12.51%)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## GRF-Informed Heterogeneity Analysis

![](QQ-GRF-Informed.png)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## GRF-Informed Heterogeneity Analysis

**Findings:**

-   Treatment effects significantly higher for children with low baseline parental investment
    -   First quartile: +0.456 SD higher effect
-   Children with below-median baseline skills benefited more
    -   +0.340 SD higher effect
-   No significant differences based on distance to FPC office

**Conclusion:** Program was most effective for disadvantaged children who lagged behind cognitively and had low initial parental investment

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Key Takeaways

-   Heterogeneity analysis provides crucial insights beyond average effects
-   Two main approaches:
    -   Pre-specified subgroup analysis (theory-driven)
    -   Data-driven methods like causal forests (exploratory)
-   Best practice: Use both approaches complementarily
-   Results can guide:
    -   Program targeting
    -   Mechanism understanding
    -   External validity assessments

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Using Heterogeneity Insights

-   **Program design**: Target children with greatest potential benefit
-   **Resource allocation**: Direct resources where most effective
-   **Implementation science**: Understand contextual factors affecting success
-   **Theory development**: Refine understanding of causal mechanisms
-   **Scale-up decisions**: Predict effectiveness in new populations
