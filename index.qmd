## Welcome

HPM 883 is an advanced graduate-level course designed to equip PhD students in Health Policy and Management with sophisticated quantitative research skills. This course is the third installment in the quantitative methods sequence, building on foundations from HPM 881 and HPM 882.

**Focus Areas:**

- Experimental design and randomization inference
- Double/Debiased Machine Learning (DML)
- Heterogeneous treatment effects and causal forests
- Policy learning and optimal treatment rules
- Modern causal inference methods (DiD, synthetic controls)
