## Course Description

HPM 883 is an advanced graduate-level course designed to equip PhD students in Health Policy and Management with sophisticated quantitative research skills. This course is the third installment in the quantitative methods sequence, building on foundations from HPM 881 and HPM 882.

The course integrates experimental design principles with modern causal machine learning methods, following a three-layer framework: **Identification → Estimation → Decision**.

**Focus Areas:**

- Experimental design and randomization inference
- Double/Debiased Machine Learning (DML)
- Heterogeneous treatment effects and causal forests
- Policy learning and optimal treatment rules
- Modern causal inference methods (DiD, synthetic controls)

**Course Format:** This is a hybrid course combining in-person lectures (theory and discussion) with remote Zoom sessions (coding labs and implementation).

## Policies

### AI Use Policy

The use of AI tools (such as ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, or Claude) is **permitted and encouraged** for:

- Debugging code
- Understanding error messages
- Learning syntax and package functions
- Generating code snippets for adaptation

However, you are responsible for all code you submit — AI-generated code must be understood, tested, and verified. Conceptual understanding cannot be outsourced.

### Late Work

- Late submissions: -10% per 24 hours
- After 48 hours: No credit without prior arrangement
- Extensions may be granted for documented circumstances if requested before the deadline
