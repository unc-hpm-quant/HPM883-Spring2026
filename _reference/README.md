# Reference Materials

This directory contains reusable reference materials that are valuable across semesters.

## Power Simulation

The `power-simulation/` directory contains J-PAL power analysis tutorials and R scripts.

### Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `J-PAL_Power_by_simulation_clusters.R` | Power simulation with cluster randomization |
| `J-PAL_Power_by_simulation_no_clusters.R` | Power simulation without clusters |
| `JPAL_Power_built_in_commands.R` | Using built-in power commands |

### Usage

These scripts demonstrate:
1. Power analysis by simulation
2. Handling clustered designs
3. Comparison with analytical formulas

### Source

Original materials from J-PAL research resources, adapted for HPM 883.
