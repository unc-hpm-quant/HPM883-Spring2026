## Session Overview

Guest lecture by **Tara Templin** (Stanford University) on machine learning methods for health economics and causal inference. Dr. Templin's research bridges ML methods and applied health economics, making this an ideal bridge between our experimental design foundations and DML theory.

**Format:** Remote (Zoom)

## Guest Lecture
This is a guest lecture delivered remotely via Zoom. Please join on time and have questions prepared.
:::

**Learning Objectives:**

1.  See applied examples of ML methods in health economics research
2.  Understand the practical considerations for using ML in causal inference
3.  Connect theoretical ML foundations to real-world applications
4.  Identify common pitfalls when applying ML to policy questions

## In Class

**Guest Lecture Topics (Tentative):**

1.  ML in health economics: opportunities and challenges
2.  Case studies from applied research
