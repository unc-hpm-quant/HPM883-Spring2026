title: "Unit 1: Experimental Design"
subtitle: "Session 1.1: Randomization & RCTs"

## Session Overview

This session establishes the foundations of experimental design: why randomization works, what it identifies, and how to think about causal estimands in randomized controlled trials. We build on the potential outcomes framework from Unit 0 to understand how randomization solves the fundamental problem of causal inference.

**Format:** In-Person (Rosenau 228)

## Note: January 19 is MLK Day (No Class)

Lab 0 is due January 19.

**Learning Objectives:**

1.  Explain why randomization identifies causal effects
2.  Define key estimands: ATE, ATT, ITT, LATE
3.  Distinguish design-based from model-based inference
4.  Understand the role of the assignment mechanism
5.  Apply the Neyman-Rubin framework to analyze experiments

## In Class

-   [Lecture Slides](session-1-1-slides.qmd)

**Topics Covered:**

1.  **Why Randomization Works**
    -   Randomization as the "reasoned basis for inference"
    -   Independence of potential outcomes and treatment
    -   Eliminating confounding by design
    -   The role of chance in inference

2.  **Causal Estimands**
    -   Average Treatment Effect (ATE)
    -   Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT)
    -   Intent-to-Treat (ITT) vs. Treatment-on-Treated (TOT)
    -   Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE)
    -   Choosing the right estimand for your question

3.  **Design-Based vs. Model-Based Inference**
    -   Randomization inference (Fisher, Neyman)
    -   Model-based inference (regression)
    -   When they agree and when they differ
    -   Robust standard errors and why they matter

4.  **The Assignment Mechanism**
    -   Complete randomization
    -   Bernoulli randomization
    -   Block/stratified randomization (preview)
    -   Cluster randomization (preview)

**Discussion:**

-   What assumptions does randomization buy us?
-   When might an RCT still fail to identify causal effects?

## Key Concepts Summary

| Concept | Definition |
|---------|------------|
| **Randomization** | Random assignment of treatment ensures $Y(0), Y(1) \perp Z$ |
| **ATE** | $E[Y(1) - Y(0)]$ — Average effect across population |
| **ATT** | $E[Y(1) - Y(0) | Z=1]$ — Effect on those who received treatment |
| **ITT** | Effect of assignment (regardless of compliance) |
| **Design-based** | Inference based on randomization distribution |
| **Model-based** | Inference based on assumed data-generating process |
