title: "Unit 1: Experimental Design"
subtitle: "Session 5: Statistical Conclusion Validity & Power"
date: "January 21, 2026"
---

## Session Overview

This session covers the foundations of statistical inference in experiments: how to design studies with adequate power, understand Type I/II errors, and implement power analysis by simulation. We'll also discuss proper regression adjustment using Lin (2013).

**Format:** In-Person (Rosenau 228)

::: callout-note
## Note: January 19 is MLK Day (No Class)

Session 4 is cancelled. Lab 0 is due January 19.
:::

**Learning Objectives:**

1.  Distinguish statistical conclusion validity from internal validity
2.  Calculate power analytically and by simulation
3.  Apply Lin (2013) regression adjustment properly
4.  Use DeclareDesign to diagnose experimental designs
5.  Understand minimum detectable effects (MDE)
