subtitle: "Session 1.3: Optimal Experimental Design & MIDA Framework"
date: "January 28, 2026"

## Session Overview

This session introduces the Model-Inquiry-Data-Answer (MIDA) framework for declaring and diagnosing research designs. We'll cover advanced randomization techniques including blocking, stratification, and cluster randomization, and explore variance reduction methods like CUPED and ANCOVA.

**Format:** In-Person (Rosenau 228)

**Learning Objectives:**

1.  Apply the MIDA framework to declare research designs formally
2.  Choose appropriate randomization strategies (simple, blocked, clustered)
3.  Implement variance reduction techniques (blocking, CUPED, ANCOVA)
4.  Diagnose designs for power, bias, and coverage
5.  Navigate practical design tradeoffs in health services research

**Topics Covered:**

1.  **The MIDA Framework**
    -   Model: Data generating process
    -   Inquiry: What we want to learn (estimand)
    -   Data Strategy: How we collect data (sampling, assignment)
    -   Answer Strategy: How we estimate (estimator)

2.  **Advanced Randomization**
    -   Blocked/stratified randomization
    -   Cluster randomization
    -   Factorial designs
    -   Adaptive randomization

3.  **Variance Reduction**
    -   CUPED (Controlled-experiment Using Pre-Experiment Data)
    -   ANCOVA adjustment
    -   Pre-stratification vs. post-stratification
    -   Optimal blocking strategies

4.  **Design Diagnosis**
    -   Power curves
    -   Bias assessment
    -   Coverage probabilities
    -   Design-based vs. model-based inference

**Live Coding:**

-   Implementing blocked randomization with `randomizr`
-   Diagnosing designs with `diagnose_design()`
-   Comparing simple vs. blocked designs
