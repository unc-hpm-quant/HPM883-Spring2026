## Overview

This unit establishes the foundations of experimental design for causal inference. We begin with why randomization works — how it solves the fundamental problem of causal inference by breaking the link between potential outcomes and treatment assignment. We then cover statistical power and validity, followed by optimal design strategies to maximize precision under constraints.

By the end of this unit, you will have the tools to design, diagnose, and defend a randomized controlled trial using modern computational methods.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this unit, students will be able to:

1. Explain why randomization identifies causal effects and distinguish key estimands (ATE, ATT, ITT, LATE)
2. Calculate statistical power analytically and by simulation using DeclareDesign
3. Apply the MIDA framework to formally declare and diagnose research designs
4. Implement variance reduction techniques (blocking, CUPED, Lin regression)
5. Navigate practical tradeoffs in experimental design for health services research

## Key Concepts

- **Randomization:** Random assignment ensures $Y(0), Y(1) \perp Z$, breaking confounding
- **Estimands:** ATE, ATT, ITT, LATE — choosing what we want to learn
- **Power:** Probability of detecting a true effect ($1 - \beta$)
- **MDE:** Minimum Detectable Effect given sample size and power target
- **MIDA Framework:** Model-Inquiry-Data-Answer for design declaration
- **Variance Reduction:** Blocking, CUPED, Lin regression to increase precision
